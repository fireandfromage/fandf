        <h1>The King Of Cheese</h1>

        <p>Chef Degen Reinhardt Storrer</p>

        <p>
          Started Fire and Fromage in 2018. His vision is to build his career
          entirely focused on the lovely sectionerse product known as cheese.
        </p>

        <p>
          After finishing culinary school in 2015, Chef Degen was left with a
          choice that we all face, “What next?”
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2016 he went to work up at Sundance resort up Provo canyon. There
          he delved more into his chosen profession, and grew in both skill and
          knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          2017 was a great year of change. Adding a new child to his family in
          late 2016 and finding his wife expecting again in late 2017 left Chef
          Degen with a choice, take his career into his own hands, or never
          achieve his dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Chef Degen was deciding in what direction he wanted to take his
          career, he considered his own consistent culinary passion, CHEESE!
        </p>

        <p>
          Raclette being the king of all cheese dishes, seemed to be a natural
          choice!
